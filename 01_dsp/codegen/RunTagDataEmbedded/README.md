This is a work in progress. This was autogenerated using the MATLAB Coder. It just finds the peak bin and the SNR at that peak bin using a basic correlation-based peak identification process.

### Local computer

Copy to the BBB.
```bash
scp -r RunTagDataEmbedded root@192.168.7.2:/root/[PATH]
```

### BBB

Build on BBB. (Probably could just rename this the makefile and Makefile to make it run with make...)
```bash
make -f RunTagDataEmbedded_rtw.mk
```

Link to a main file and run (because the makefile generates a static library).
```bash
gcc main.c RunTagDataEmbedded.lib -lm
```

Run
```bash
./main -captureName <captureName> -localDataPath <localDataPath> -tagHz <tagHz>
```
