# MATLAB Code for Radar Interface

Welcome to the MATLAB code repository for interfacing with radar(s). This codebase primarily interacts with FlatEarth libraries, demo code, and the WADAR scripts. The wadar* files are used to automatically collect and process data from the radar. The proc* files manually process previously collected data.
