The term ``precision agriculture'' has been around since the 1980s,
and it describes a farming technique that uses extensive measurement
of crop data to make informed decisions about watering, fertilization
and more. Despite decades of work, precision agriculture is still not
widely implemented on working farms. This is because the data is hard
to collect and process, primarily due to the lack of high speed
internet access in rural areas, and the high cost and difficulty of
deploying dense sensor networks. Recent work \cite{farmbeats} has made good progress in
addressing the issues of internet access, but the cost and
deployability of sensors remains an issue. We seek to address this by designing a low-cost and easy-to-use wireless soil moisture sensor.

One of the most important measurements in agriculture is soil
moisture. 69\% of the world's fresh water is
