rshutdown is a bash script to properly shut down the radar. To use it:

- Make sure /usr/sbin is in your path (you can check this by executing
`echo $PATH`

- As sudo copy the rshutdown file to the /usr/sbin directory. 

You should now be able to execute rshutdown from any directory in the
terminal. The command takes a few seconds, it is done when it prints
out, "Radar shutdown complete!".
